	<summary>⬇️ How I got into programming</summary>
	👩‍🏫 As an English teacher I was presented with the opportunity of becoming an Apple Teacher to start teaching Programming Logic to kids and teens. Two years later I decided to change careers, so I started a self-taught journey, participated in a 	coding bootcamp and a hackathon where I have developed two projects that allowed me to finally become a frontend developer at Dasa where I worked for a year as junior.
