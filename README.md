<h1>About me:</h1>
👋 Hi, I’m Amanda <br>
🗺️ I'm from São Paulo, Brazil<br>
👩‍💻 I’m interested in starting a new career in tech <br>
🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Java <br>


<h1>How it started:</h1>
👩‍🏫 I'm an English teacher by trade, but I've always had an interest in technology. When the school I used to work at decided to include programming skills in the syllabus using <b>Apple's Swift Playgrounds</b> as a tool, I had to take the course to become an Apple teacher and this is when I realized I could see myself working as a developer 💻. That is why this year (2022) I have decided to become a full time student to make my career move.
<br><br>

<h1>My plans:</h1>
☑️ Become a full time student;<br>
☑️ Start my portfolio<br>
🟦 Finish at least three projects to showcase my abilities;<br>
🟦 Get my first job as a developer.<br>
